Hi Qardio team!
I'm writing to you cause I just wanna be a part of cool squad that moves world of wellbeing to the future :)
Regarding technical assignment task that I made. I have a plenty of things that I didnt manage to do due to time restrictions, but I have tried to do as many features as I can. Nice to have in the next update:
 - localisation of whole project
 - ui/unit tests
 - Networking part as a CoreDataManager needs for modifications
 - also I need some more time to figure out about problem with "jsonFlickrApi" extra field in the beginning of each API response
 - while trying to make better user expirience I decided to make unsynchronised style of photo columns, it turned out to be harder than i thought. But I hope it was worth it.
 - another nice to have thing is alerts that can help user to understend what is going wrong

here is a link for project repo (branch=develop):

I would be delighted to receive feedback from you about my work, regardless of your decision.

Looking forward for your reply
Many thanks
Aliaksei Kazhukhouski
